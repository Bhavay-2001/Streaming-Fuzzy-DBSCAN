# Streaming-Fuzzy-DBSCAN
# Fuzzy-Based DBSCAN Algorithm on Different Datasets

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Fuzzy-Based Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm applied to various datasets for research purposes. The project aims to explore the effectiveness of a Fuzzy-based approach in improving the traditional DBSCAN algorithm's clustering performance.

## Algorithm

The Fuzzy-Based DBSCAN algorithm is an extension of the traditional DBSCAN algorithm. It incorporates fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and improve cluster assignment accuracy. The implementation details can be found in the code within this repository.

## Datasets

This project uses multiple datasets to evaluate the algorithm's performance. You can find these datasets in the 'datasets' directory. Each dataset is accompanied by a brief description or link to the source.
